An education company, X Education, offers online courses designed for industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit their website to explore available courses. The website features a form that visitors can complete, after which the company records the individual as a lead. Once a lead is acquired, the sales team reaches out through calls, emails, and other communication methods. While some of these leads convert into paying customers, the majority do not. X Education currently has a lead conversion rate of approximately 30%, meaning that out of 100 daily leads, only about 30 convert. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as Hot Leads. By focusing the sales team's efforts on these Hot Leads, the conversion rate is expected to improve significantly. 

**Business Objective**  
The company seeks to develop a model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, helping to identify Hot Leads and ultimately increasing the conversion rate. The CEO has set a target conversion rate of 80%. Additionally, the model should be adaptable to future requirements, such as managing peak time actions, optimizing workforce utilization, and implementing strategies after achieving the target conversion rate.
